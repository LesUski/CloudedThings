### Hi there 👋:
- Currently I'm a Solutions Architect working at Sigma Technology Cloud
- 🔭 In 2021 I did **[100 Days in Cloud Challenge](https://github.com/CloudedThings/100-Days-in-Cloud)** doing one Cloud-related Lab each of the last hundred days of 2021.
- ☁️  My **Cloud Resume Challenge [website](https://profile.cloudofthings.net)**
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Go ahead check my blog where I post my labs and all sorts of cloud-related things [cloudofthings.net](https://cloudofthings.net/)
- :facepunch: Yeah... I like challenges (I've cycled worlds longest cycling sportee (Vatternrundan - 300 km) few times as well
- 🌱 The last big assignment in school was IoT infrastructure code with REST API and .NET -> [VHS Project](https://github.com/CloudedThings/VHS)
- ⌨️ My favorite programming language: Python or maybe C#
- ☁️ I'm a 'wannabe' cloud architect
- 🛠️ I love experimenting with embedded systems, such as ESP8266, Arduino MKR1000 and sensors
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with doing real-life projects in IoT/Cloud world
- 💬 Ask me about Internet of Things especially devices connected to cloud services
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like challenges: other one I'm up for is **read 52 books a year** which I completed in the last several years. And I'm proud of my home IoT solutions like **[Plant moisture monitoring](https://github.com/CloudedThings/HighGrowMQTT)** 😏
